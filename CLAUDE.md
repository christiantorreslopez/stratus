# Development Guidelines

This document contains critical information about working with this codebase. Follow these guidelines precisely.

## Core Development Rules

1. Package Management
   - ONLY use uv, NEVER pip
   - Installation: `uv add package`
   - Running tools: `uv run tool`
   - Upgrading: `uv add --dev package --upgrade-package package`
   - FORBIDDEN: `uv pip install`, `@latest` syntax

2. Code Quality
   - Type hints not required.
        - Ignore this for now, but keep it in this file for when I turn type hints on
            - use pyrefly for type checking
            - run `pyrefly init` to start
            - run `pyrefly check` after every change and fix resultings errors
   - Public APIs must have docstrings
   - Functions must be focused and small
   - Follow existing patterns exactly
   - Line length: 88 chars maximum

3. Testing Requirements
   - Framework: `uv run pytest`
   - Async testing: use anyio, not asyncio
   - Coverage: test edge cases and errors
   - New features require tests
   - Bug fixes require regression tests

4. Code Style
    - Document with docstrings
    - Use f-strings for formatting
    - Other style rules enforced via ruff configuration

## Development Philosophy

- **Simplicity**: Write simple, straightforward code
- **Readability**: Make code easy to understand
- **Performance**: Consider performance without sacrificing readability
- **Maintainability**: Write code that's easy to update
- **Testability**: Ensure code is testable
- **Reusability**: Create reusable components and functions
- **Less Code = Less Debt**: Minimize code footprint

## Coding Best Practices

- **Early Returns**: Use to avoid nested conditions
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear variable/function names (prefix handlers with "handle")
- **Constants Over Functions**: Use constants where possible
- **DRY Code**: Don't repeat yourself
- **Functional Style**: Prefer functional, immutable approaches when not verbose
- **Minimal Changes**: Only modify code related to the task at hand
- **Function Ordering**: Define composing functions before their components
- **TODO Comments**: Mark issues in existing code with "TODO:" prefix
- **Simplicity**: Prioritize simplicity and readability over clever solutions
- **Build Iteratively** Start with minimal functionality and verify it works before adding complexity
- **Run Tests**: Test your code frequently with realistic inputs and validate outputs
- **Build Test Environments**: Create testing environments for components that are difficult to validate directly
- **Functional Code**: Use functional and stateless approaches where they improve clarity
- **Clean logic**: Keep core logic clean and push implementation details to the edges
- **File Organization**: Balance file organization with simplicity - use an appropriate number of files for the project scale

## System Architecture

- This project is an chapter-based project

## Pull Requests

- Create a detailed message of what changed. Focus on the high level description of
  the problem it tries to solve, and how it is solved. Don't go into the specifics of the
  code unless it adds clarity.

## Git Workflow

- Commit directly to `main`
- Push directly unless otherwise requested
- Commit practices
  - Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
  - Prefer concise commit style: `short description`

## Python Tools

- use context7 mcp to check details of libraries

## Code Formatting

1. Ruff (configured in pyproject.toml, enforced via pre-commit hooks)
   - Format: `uv run ruff format .`
   - Check: `uv run ruff check .`
   - Fix: `uv run ruff check . --fix`

2. Type Checking
  - run `pyrefly init` to start
  - run `pyrefly check` after every change and fix resultings errors
   - Requirements:
     - Explicit None checks for Optional
     - Type narrowing for strings
     - Version warnings can be ignored if checks pass


## Error Resolution

1. CI Failures
   - Fix order:
     1. Formatting
     2. Type errors
     3. Linting
   - Type errors:
     - Get full line context
     - Check Optional types
     - Add type narrowing
     - Verify function signatures

2. Common Issues
   - Line length:
     - Break strings with parentheses
     - Multi-line function calls
     - Split imports
   - Types:
     - Add None checks
     - Narrow string types
     - Match existing patterns

3. Best Practices
   - Check git status before commits
   - Run formatters before type checks
   - Keep changes minimal
   - Follow existing patterns
   - Document public APIs
   - Test thoroughly
