"""
Let's write your first Python program.

This is a python file called exercise0.py. The .py extension is what tells the computer that this is a Python file.

The `print` function is used to display text or other output to the screen. Remember, programming languages have their own syntax and rules. In Python, the syntax for the `print` function looks like this below:
"""

print(Hello World)

"""
In your terminal, type: python src/chapter0/exercise0a.py

You should see "Hello" printed on the screen. Go ahead and try changing the message to say
Hello World.

Did you see how that changed the printed message?

Be sure to use quotes around your messages. In chapter 2 we will go over this in detail.

Follow the rest of the instructions to create several more print statements.
