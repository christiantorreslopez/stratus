# Chapter 0: Intro & Hello World

## About this course

- This is the first course for ACA students.
- Prerequisites: Basic computer & typing skills.

## What is Coding

Coding is creating instructions for computers using programming languages to solve problems.

## What are Programming Languages?

Programming languages, like human languages, are a way for us to communicate with computers. They have their own grammar and vocabulary.

## What is Python

Python is a popular programming language. It was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.

Python is a good first language because it's simple and easy to read. It's also highly marketable - used by Google, Facebook, and Netflix for web development, data analysis, AI, and more.

## What is VS Code?

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) is a popular code editor developed by Microsoft. It is an application that you can use to write and edit your code.

You'll need to be familiar with 3 parts:
1. The **Explorer**: A view that shows your project files and folders.
2. The **Editor**: Where you edit your code files.
3. The **Terminal**: Where you can tell your computer to run commands such as running your code.

## Comments

Comments are lines in your code that aren't executed. They're used to explain code or leave notes.

In Python, comments start with a `#` symbol.

## Docstrings

Docstrings are like multiline comments. That's all you need to know for now.

## Print

The classic first program in any language is to print "Hello, World!" to the screen. In Python, you can do this with the `print()` function. Try this out in `exercise0.py`.

## Functions

The `print()` you've been using is actually called a **function**. Functions are like verbs or actions that tell the computer what to do.

`print()` is a command that says "display this text on the screen" - the computer already knows how to do this.

### Arguments

The text inside the parentheses is called an **argument** - it's the input to the function.

```python
print("Hello World")
```

`"Hello World"` is the argument you're giving to the function.

### Calling Functions

To call a function, write its name followed by parentheses and its argument.

```python
print("Hello World")
```

You'll discover many other built-in functions as you learn. Later, you'll create your own!

## Quotes
You'll notice quotes inside the print function in exercises. Make sure to do this in your exercise. We'll cover this in Chapter 2.

## Commands

To run any Python file in your terminal, use this command pattern:

```
python path/to/your/file.py
```

**Examples:**
- `python src/chapter0/exercise0a.py`
- `python src/chapter1/exercise1a.py`
- `python answers/chapter0/answers0a.py`

**Note:** If unsure of your current location, type `pwd` to see where you are.
