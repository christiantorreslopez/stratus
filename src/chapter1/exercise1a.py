Let's learn about variables!

A Variable is a container for a value. A variable consists of 2 parts: a name and a value.

To create a variable, you use the equals sign (`=`) to assign a value to a variable name.
Note that in code, this equal sign means "gets" rather than "equals".
"""

# This line of code below makes a variable called 'weather_condition' which gets the value, "sunny"
weather_condition = "sunny"
print(weather_condition)

"""
Did you see how we created a variable and then printed it? Think about the difference between what we just did and how we printed the same message directly without a variable in chapter 0. It is good practice to use variables instead of using values directly. In later chapters you'll see why this is critical.

Follow the instructions below to create your own weather variables.
"""

# Create a variable called 'city' and store your city name in it.
city = 'Houston'
state = 'TX'
print(city)
print(state)

# Print your city variable.

# Create a variable called 'state' and store the state name.

# Print your state variable.
