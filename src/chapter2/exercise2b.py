"""
Let's practice working with numbers - integers and floats!

Integers are whole numbers, and floats are decimal numbers
"""

# Print happens to take care of not only strings but also numbers, how convenient!
temperature = 75
print(temperature)

# Make two variables. One called high_temp, another low_temp. Set them to integers of your choice. Then print the difference between the two.

# Use the two variables and print their sum, difference, product, and division results to see how Python handles math operations with ints.

# Make a two variable called wind_mph, rainfall_inches and give them float values

# Use the two variables and print their sum, difference, product, and division results to see how Python handles math operations with floats.

"""
Now let's work with floats
"""

# Create a float variable for expected rainfall in inches (like 1.2 or 0.5)

# Create a float variable for wind speed in mph (like 8.7)

# Print both of your float variables

# Do some math: calculate what the wind speed would be if it doubled

# Convert a temperature: if it's 20 degrees Celsius, what is it in Fahrenheit?
# Formula: (Celsius * 9/5) + 32
