Let's learn how to create and use functions!

# Here's an example function that prints a weather message


def show_weather(city):
    print("Today's weather in", city, "is beautiful!")


# And this is how to Call the function
show_weather("Houston")

"""
Did you see how we defined the function with 'def' and then called it by using its name
with parentheses?

Now let's practice creating your own weather functions!
"""

# Create a function called 'show_temperature' that takes a parameter (input) called "temperature" and prints a message about it

# Call your function to test it

# Create a function called 'show_temperature_in_city' that takes two parameters: "temperature", and "city", and prints a message about it

# Call your show_temperature_in_city function
